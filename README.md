# Level-Up-Python-Challenges
All Python challenges from the LinkedIn course Level up: Python

## Disclaimer
I am a computer science student looking to gain experience by doing projects and classes.
My code isn't perfect, neither is my documentation. That is why I am here to practice. 
Sometime I do something extremely complicated when the solution can be only 3 lines. Though, that goes to show how unique coding is and the endless possibilites.
Thank you for understanding! :D
